# Search-and-Replace Assignment

A program that preforms a
text search-and-replace very efficiently
on a given input file. The purpose of this repo is to
provide evidence of the quality of code I can write in C++.

This program was originally written as an assignment
for an *Advanced Object-Oriented Design* class.
The `draft` directory contains my original implementation
of the program. This implementation worked in all test cases,
and the main routine of the program has a fun Macbeth theme.
But this design was lacking a key Object-Oriented feature
that the instructor wanted our programs to include.
The `redesign` directory contains my attempt at using this feature.
This redesign works only in *most* test cases (it misses a
few corner cases).
